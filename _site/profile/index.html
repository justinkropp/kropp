        <p>Mads Faraday is a US-born graphic designer, writer, and photographer based in the foothills of Southeast Tennessee.</p>
        
        <p>Mads' personal work blends intimate experiences with broader themes through art and design, creating ideas that resonate universally. His diverse subjects reflect modern life's complexities, including popular culture, iconography, design systems, typography, nature, memories, and emotions.</p>

        <p>His reflective approach explores contrasts: natural versus man-made, traditional versus modern, and historical versus contemporary. Through his art, he invites viewers to ponder these dichotomies, fostering a deeper understanding of our multifaceted world.</p>
            
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
            
        <p>I embrace life as a positive nihilist. While I recognize that life has no predetermined purpose, I actively create meaning through living fully and embracing all experiences. Being here is an extraordinary circumstance that deserves to be celebrated through bold exploration and engagement with life. Our single existence demands nothing less than pursuing the countless adventures and experiences this vast world offers. I stand firmly as an outspoken anti-theist, confident in this position.</p> 
            
        <h2>Career</h2>
            
        <p>With a strong foundation in Graphic Design, I established my career in an agency environment mastering traditional design work - from compelling branding and logo design to impactful posters, intuitive wayfinding, and immersive exhibition design. Those analog days were truly formative.</p> 
            
        <p>In 2008, I decisively expanded into digital design while pursuing my graduate studies, carving out a successful path as a product designer and design engineer in the tech sector. Throughout this journey, I've worked extensively with and championed the Open Source Software (OSS) community - a movement whose principles and potential continue to inspire me.</p>
            
        <p>Design remains my driving force and true calling. Yet after 15+ years in tech, I've gained a clearer perspective on the industry's limitations, leading me to critically examine my relationship with the tech and startup ecosystem.</p>
