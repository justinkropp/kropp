        <p>I'm Justin Kropp, a graphic designer. Most of my work these days sits firmly in the product design bucket and lives exclusively on screens &mdash; big and small. I'm currently a <em>Staff Product Designer</em> at <a href="https://vercel.com/design">Vercel</a>. Previously, I held <em>Staff Product Design</em> roles at <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/">Modern Treasury</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, and <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>.</p>

        <p>I maintain a small design practice, producing self-initiated work that is primarily auto-ethnographic in approach, connecting personal experiences with the wider world through an art and design lens. Themes that wander through this work include: design systems, typography, the written word, form, nature, music, and emotion.</p>
